# EPFImporter
A Python CLI tool for importing Apple Enterprise Partner Feed data, available to EPF partners, into a relational database.

Made for both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. Should be used with Python 2, lot more issues in Python 3.

Currently correcting psycopg2 integration errors (for PostgreSQL databases interactions)
